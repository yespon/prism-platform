## 1. Positioning & Principles

### 1.1 Platform Positioning

**Governed Agent Platform** — enabling any organization to securely create, deploy, and manage its own digital workforce. Governance is not a feature layer; it is the structural guarantee that every tool call, every data access, and every agent action is intercepted, evaluated, and audited at the deterministic code level — not at the probabilistic prompt level.

### 1.2 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Governance First** | Governance is deterministic, not probabilistic. RBAC, audit, policy enforcement, and tool-call interception are **builtin** — not optional plugins. Policy Engine is always on; only policy strictness is configurable. |
| **Extension Architecture** | The platform core is minimal. Capabilities are extended through five levers: Builtin SPIs (always-on governance), Extension SPIs (optional capabilities), Event Hooks, Skills (lazy-loaded), and Prompt Templates. |
| **Dual-Track Users** | Serves both bottom-up individual productivity and top-down enterprise provisioning. |
| **Context Engineering** | Context determines agent capability ceiling. Prompt templates, compression, window management, and retrieval strategies are platform-level concerns. |
| **Harness over Model** | Engineering around the model (tools, context, memory, evaluation, governance) outlasts any single model generation. The harness is the moat. |
| **Defense in Depth** | Perimeter security (RBAC, audit) + Compliance (policy engine, OWASP) + Runtime security (sandbox, capability tokens). No single layer is sufficient. |
| **Governance as Foundation, Extension as Superstructure** | Policy Engine is the foundation (like an OS kernel) — builtin, always-on, non-optional. Extension SPIs are the superstructure (like user-space programs) — optional, configurable, distributable. Governance is the ground the platform stands on; everything else is built on top. This resolves the tension between "minimal core" and "always-on governance": the core is minimal in its *extension* surface, not in its *governance* surface. |
| **Layered Independence** | Each architectural layer is independently usable. In v2.0+, the Agent Loop can be used standalone (SDK mode) after LangGraph is replaced. In v1.2–v1.7, the Agent Loop is a decoupling abstraction over LangGraph — usable via SDK but not yet independent of LangGraph. Policy Engine is embedded in the Agent Loop at SDK level, and gateway-level at platform level. Governance is everywhere; the deployment topology varies. |
| **Open Evolution** | From single-organization governance to cross-organization federation. Governance capabilities should be open-sourced to build community trust and set standards. |

### 1.3 Explicit Non-Goals

To prevent scope creep, these are explicitly out of scope for all versions:

| Non-Goal | Rationale | Alternative |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Building proprietary LLM | We consume models, not train them | Model management (v1.0) already supports 20+ third-party providers |
| Replacing Kubernetes / container orchestration | Existing infrastructure is mature | Sandbox layer integrates with Docker/K8s |
| General-purpose BI tool | AI Analysis Workbench is agent-scoped, not standalone BI | Use dedicated BI tools for BI needs |
| Prompt-level safety | Governance is at deterministic code layer, not probabilistic prompt layer | Policy Engine (v1.4) enforces at tool-call interception |
| Building a cloud hosting service | Self-hosted platform | Docker one-command deploy; edge deployment in v2.0 |
| Chatbot / conversational AI as primary product | Platform is agent governance, not chat UI | Chat workspace is one interface among many |
| Mobile client | Desktop/server-first platform | Web UI is responsive; no native mobile app planned |

### 1.4 Strategic Pivot

v1.1 completed the "de-ops" transition. v1.2 extracts the Agent Loop as an abstraction layer over LangGraph (decoupling, not replacement) — the first step toward v2.0's autonomous runtime. v1.3 builds the workflow engine. v1.4 introduces the compliance layer. v1.5 delivers the digital employee framework and extension system. v1.6 adds the data connector layer. v1.7 adds enterprise security, session DAG, multi-run modes, and removes the DeerFlow loop. v1.8 establishes context engineering. v1.9 adds evaluation, SRE governance, and feedback loops. v2.0 replaces LangGraph entirely, achieving architectural independence with identity mesh and federation.

**Key change from v5**: Overloaded versions (v1.2 with 9 P0s, v1.4 with 9 P0s, v1.6 with 10 P0s) have been split into focused, deliverable increments. Each version now targets 3-8 P0 items.

### 1.5 Version Cadence Assumptions

These are planning assumptions, not commitments. Actual velocity depends on team size and availability.

| Version | Estimated Duration | Suggested Team |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| v1.2 | 2-3 months | 2 backend |
| v1.3 | 2-3 months | 2 backend + 1 frontend |
| v1.4 | 2 months | 1-2 backend |
| v1.5 | 3-4 months | 2 backend + 1 frontend |
| v1.6 | 2-3 months | 1-2 backend |
| v1.7 | 3-4 months | 2 backend + 1 frontend + 1 DevOps |
| v1.8 | 2-3 months | 1-2 backend |
| v1.9 | 2-3 months | 2 backend + 1 frontend |
| v2.0 | 4-6 months | 2 backend + 1 frontend + 1 DevOps |

**Total**: ~22-31 months from v1.2 to v2.0 with the suggested team size. A smaller team (1-2 people total) should expect 2-3x the duration.

### 1.6 Industry Context

| Source | Key Insight Adopted | Roadmap Impact |

| AI Agent Book (bojieli) | Agent = LLM + Context + Tools; Harness engineering is core competency | v1.8 context engineering |
| Alibaba Cloud 2025 AI Architecture | Evaluation as full-lifecycle capability; data flywheel | v1.9 evaluation framework |

### 1.7 Business Model & Sustainability

A 22-31 month roadmap requires a sustainability model. The platform is self-hosted open source; revenue comes from three streams, not from hosting:

| Stream | Description | Target Version |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Open Source Core** | Full platform (v1.0–v2.0) is Apache 2.0 / MIT. No feature gates. Self-hostable at no cost. | All versions |
| **Enterprise Edition** | Advanced features for enterprise: Edge Deployment (v2.0 P1), Agent Federation (v2.0 P1), Identity Mesh (v2.0), SSO/LDAP (v1.7). Released as open source but with commercial support contracts. | v1.7+ |
| **Governance Toolkit Commercial Support** | The 4 Open Governance libraries (v2.0) are Apache 2.0. Commercial offering: SLA-backed support, custom policy packs, integration consulting. | v2.0 |
| **Hosted Option (future, not committed)** | If demand emerges post-v2.0, a managed hosted version may be considered. Not in current roadmap. | Post-v2.0 |

**Principle**: The open source core is never feature-gated. Enterprise value is in support, advanced deployment topologies, and consulting — not in withholding features. This aligns with Microsoft AGT's open governance approach and Pi-Agent's fully-open model.

**Sustainability assumption**: The platform is maintained by the author + community contributors during v1.x. Commercial revenue is expected to begin with v1.7 (Enterprise Edition features). If commercial traction is insufficient by v1.9, v2.0 scope will be reduced to match available resources.

### 1.8 Market Window Analysis

The governance and agent platform space is evolving rapidly. This analysis frames the competitive window:

| Window | Analysis | Roadmap Response |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Governance standardization** | Microsoft AGT (v4.1, 45→5 packages) is converging the governance toolkit space. If we wait until v2.0 to open-source, AGT may be the de facto standard. | Consider pulling Open Governance Toolkit forward to v1.4 (Policy Engine release) — but this conflicts with v1.4's focused scope. Decision deferred to v1.4 planning. |
| **DeerFlow upstream** | DeerFlow is ByteDance's project; its evolution is not under our control. If DeerFlow stops maintenance or pivots, v1.2–v1.7 are affected. | Agent Loop extraction (v1.2) is itself the hedge — the earlier we decouple, the lower the upstream risk. |
| **Agent platform consolidation** | LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK are competing. By v1.7 (~15-18 months, DeerFlow removed) and v2.0 (~22+ months, full independence), the field may have consolidated. | Our differentiation is *governance* (deterministic, not probabilistic) and *self-hosted enterprise*. Neither is well-served by current competitors. v1.7 is the first major architecture milestone; v2.0 is full independence. |
| **Single-user vs enterprise** | Pi-Agent (64K stars) proved single-user demand. Enterprise agent platforms are underserved. | Our enterprise + governance positioning avoids direct competition with single-user tools. |

**Risk**: If the field consolidates before v2.0, federation (v2.0) may be solving a problem that standardization has already addressed. Monitor and adjust.

## 2. Version Planning

Each version lists capabilities with priority tags:
- **(P0)** — Must deliver for this version to ship
- **(P1)** — Can slip to the next version if needed

### v1.0 — Governed Agent Platform (Current)

```
✅ Multi-tenancy + RBAC + Audit
✅ 20+ model provider templates, database-backed
✅ Visual admin dashboards (platform + tenant)
✅ Skill System with sandbox testing
✅ Docker one-command deploy
```

### v1.1 — Platform Slimming & Repositioning (Completed)

| Scope | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Architecture Decoupling | Alerting pipeline, terminal governance, asset management → optional plugins |
| Interface Definition | Plugin SPIs: `EventSource`, `Executor`, `Notifier` |
| Narrative Rewrite | "AI-Native Operations" → "Governed Agent Platform" |
| tenant_type Rename | Default "ops" → "general" |
| Plugin API | `GET /api/plugins` endpoint; frontend `usePlugins()` hook; nav filtering |

### v1.2 — Agent Loop Primitive

**Focus**: Extract the Agent Loop as an abstraction layer over LangGraph, decoupling platform code from DeerFlow-specific APIs. This is the first step toward v2.0's autonomous runtime (which replaces LangGraph entirely). No workflow engine yet — that comes in v1.3. Note: v1.2 is decoupling, not independence from LangGraph.

| Priority | Scope | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | **Agent Loop Primitive** | **Extract Agent Loop abstraction layer over LangGraph, decoupling platform code from LangGraph-specific APIs. Runs in parallel with existing DeerFlow loop via feature flag. Note: v1.2 is decoupling, not replacement — LangGraph is still the underlying runtime. v2.0 replaces LangGraph entirely.** |
| **P0** | **Tool Registry** | **Unified tool definition schema (JSON Schema validation), tool discovery API, tool lifecycle (register/discover/deprecate).** |
| **P0** | **Message System** | **Conversation history representation and passing. Multi-turn state machine. Interface is implementation-agnostic; in v1.2–v1.7 the implementation still adapts to LangGraph's message model. Truly independent at v2.0.** |
| **P1** | Executor Interface | Agent dialogue / Code sandbox / HTTP call / Terminal (plugin executor). Basic interface definition; full implementation in v1.3. |

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Parallel run strategy:**

```
v1.2 deployment:
  ├─ Agent Loop runs alongside DeerFlow's existing LangGraph loop
  ├─ Feature flag: OPSINTECH_AGENT_LOOP=new|legacy (default: legacy)
  ├─ Both loops share the same Tool Registry and Message System
  ├─ Automated comparison tests:
  │   ├─ Tool-call sequence match rate (allows order differences, target ≥90%)
  │   ├─ Final result success rate (human-evaluated sample, target: no statistically significant difference)
  │   └─ Latency distribution (p50/p95 comparison, target: Agent Loop within ±10% of DeerFlow)
  └─ Telemetry: track latency, success rate, divergence rate for both loops
```

**DeerFlow deprecation timeline:**

```
v1.2: Agent Loop extracted (parallel to DeerFlow, feature-flag toggle)
v1.3: Agent Loop becomes default; DeerFlow loop marked deprecated
v1.7: DeerFlow loop removed; only Agent Loop remains
v2.0: LangGraph orchestration replaced; DeerFlow dependency fully removed
```

### v1.3 — Workflow Engine

**Focus**: Build the automation layer. The Agent Loop (v1.2) is the "employee"; the Workflow Engine is the "project manager". This version assumes v1.2's Agent Loop is stable and available as an execution unit.

| Priority | Scope | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | Event Source Abstraction | Webhook / Scheduled / File change / Message queue |
| **P0** | Workflow Orchestration | DAG steps, conditional branches, parallel/serial, human approval nodes, retry/timeout |
| **P0** | **Saga Pattern (Idempotent Retry + Selective Compensation)** | **Idempotent retry with exponential backoff for all steps. Selective compensation rollback for steps with reversible side effects (e.g., sent notifications can be revoked; executed SQL cannot be "un-executed"). Note: Agent workflow failure modes differ from microservice transactions — most steps support retry, not compensation.** |
| **P0** | **Kill Switch (Infrastructure)** | **Emergency stop all in-flight workflows per tenant/workflow level. Foundation for per-agent kill switch in v1.9.** |
| **P0** | Executor Interface | Full implementation: Agent dialogue / Code sandbox / HTTP call / Terminal (as plugin executor) |
| **P0** | Audit Closure | Event → Workflow → Execution → Result, full-chain traceable and replayable |
| **P1** | **Circuit Breaker** | **Auto-pause workflow after N consecutive failures; manual or time-based reset. Foundation for SLO-driven circuit breaker in v1.9.** |
| **P1** | Built-in Workflow Templates | Scheduled reports, data sync, multi-Agent collaboration |

**Agent Loop vs Workflow Engine coexistence:**

| Aspect | Agent Loop (v1.2) | Workflow Engine (v1.3) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Role | "Employee" — single Agent's brain | "Project Manager" — cross-system orchestration |
| Duration | Minutes to hours | Hours to days |
| State | In-memory (checkpoint) | Database persistent, recoverable |
| Human Intervention | In-conversation (v1.7+) | Async approval nodes, suspend/resume |
| Cross-System | None | Saga pattern, idempotent retry + selective compensation |
| Failure Recovery | Restart = lost context | Resume from database state |
| Audit | Single conversation | Full-chain, replayable |
| Deployment | Standalone SDK or platform-embedded | Requires platform infrastructure |

```
Workflow: Trigger → Step1(HTTP) → Step2(Agent) → Step3(Approve) → Step4(Agent) → Done
                              │                  │                 │
                              ▼                  ▼                 ▼
                         Agent Loop          Human waits        Agent Loop
                         (v1.2)              (hours/days)       (v1.2)
```

### v1.4 — Agent Compliance Layer

**Focus**: Deterministic governance. Policy Engine is always-on, builtin — not optional. This is the structural guarantee that every tool call is intercepted.

| Priority | Scope | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | **Policy Engine (Builtin)** | **Deterministic tool-call interception engine. Always on — not optional, not a plugin. Policy strictness is configurable; the engine itself is not.** |
| **P0** | **Policy as Code** | **YAML-based declarative policies. `default_action: deny` with explicit `allow` rules.** |
| **P0** | **OWASP Agentic AI Top 10** | **Built-in compliance rule set covering all 10 categories. Enabled by default for high-severity rules.** |
| **P0** | **Tamper-Evident Audit Log** | **Merkle-tree structured audit trail. Decision BOM (active policy, agent request, allow/deny reason).** |
| **P1** | Policy Lint & Validation | Static analysis of policy files — catch misconfigurations before deployment. |
| **P1** | MCP Security Gateway | Tool poisoning detection, drift monitoring, typosquatting detection, hidden instruction scanning. |
| **P1** | Shadow AI Discovery | Cross-process/config/repo discovery of unregistered agents. |

**Policy as Code example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: governance.opsintech.io/v1
name: finance-agent-policy
default_action: deny
rules:
  - name: allow-read-only-db
    condition: "tool_name == 'db_query' && action == 'SELECT'"
    action: allow
  - name: require-approval-write
    condition: "tool_name == 'db_query' && action in ['INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE']"
    action: require_approval
    approvers: ["tenant_admin"]
  - name: deny-external-network
    condition: "tool_name == 'http_request' && !target_host.endswith('.internal')"
    action: deny
```

**Policy Engine is always-on — migration strategy:**

```
v1.3 → v1.4 upgrade:
  ├─ Policy Engine activated (builtin, cannot be disabled)
  ├─ OWASP high-severity rules: default deny (platform-managed, tenant cannot override)
  ├─ Custom policies: default allow (tenant writes their own policies)
  ├─ agt verify command shows tenant their current policy coverage gaps
  └─ No breaking change: existing tool calls pass through with default-allow custom policies
```

**Policy Engine deployment modes:**

| Mode | Description | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Platform embedded** | Policy Engine runs in the Compliance Layer of the platform. All tool calls pass through the gateway. | Normal platform deployment |

SDK deployment modes (Embedded / Remote) are defined in v1.7 when the SDK is introduced.

### v1.5 — Digital Employee Framework + Extension System

**Focus**: Enable users to create, customize, and manage their own Agents. Introduce the full extension system. Skills become lazy-loaded. Prompt Templates are delivered as a complete system here.

| Priority | Scope | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | Custom Agent Enhancement | system_prompt templating (variable injection) + tool group whitelisting + skill binding + memory policy configuration |
| **P0** | Agent Lifecycle | Draft → Sandbox test → Publish → Version management → Usage statistics → Retirement |
| **P0** | **Prompt Template System** | **Variable injection, version management, per-tenant defaults, slash-command loadable, reusable markdown templates. Delivered as a complete system — not fragmented across versions.** |
| **P0** | **Extension System** | **Five-lever architecture: Builtin SPIs, Extension SPIs, Event Hooks, Skills (lazy-load), Prompt Templates** |
| **P0** | **Skill Lazy Loading** | **Progressive disclosure — metadata always visible, full instructions + tools loaded only on invocation.** |
| **P0** | Skill Marketplace Phase 1 | Git repository import + Official skill library + Tenant-internal sharing |
| **P0** | Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol | Intra-tenant Agent discovery, capability advertisement, and direct invocation |
| **P1** | Multi-Agent Collaboration | Sequential (pipeline), Parallel (fan-out), Debate (multi-perspective) modes |
| **P1** | Skill Trust Scoring | Download count, user ratings, security scan results, source verification |
| **P0** | Admin Perspective | Agent provisioning, usage statistics, cost control, permission approval |

**Extension System — Two SPI Categories:**

| Category | SPIs | Toggle | Examples |
|----------|------|--------|----------|
| **Builtin SPIs** | PolicyEnforcer | Always on, strictness configurable | Policy Engine, MCP Security Gateway |
| **Extension SPIs** | EventSource, Executor, Notifier, DataConnector | Optional, config-toggle | ops-alerting, data-connector-pg, approval-engine |

**Extension System — Five Levers:**

| Lever | Mechanism | Hot Reload | Distribution |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Builtin SPIs** | PolicyEnforcer — always on, not optional | Configurable strictness | Platform core |
| **Extension SPIs** | EventSource, Executor, Notifier, DataConnector | Via config toggle | Built-in registry |
| **Event Hooks** | Agent lifecycle hooks: `tool_call_before/after`, `turn_start/end`, `error`, `session_start/end` | Hot reload | Extension packages |
| **Skills** | Lazy-loaded "instruction + tools" packs. Progressive disclosure. Metadata always visible, full content on invocation. | Hot reload | Git import + marketplace |
| **Prompt Templates** | Reusable markdown templates with parameter substitution. Slash-command loadable. Version-controlled. Variable injection, version management, per-tenant defaults. | Hot reload | Template marketplace |

**Prompt Template delivery:**

v1.5 delivers the complete Prompt Template system — variable injection, version management, per-tenant defaults, slash-command loading, reusable markdown templates. This is NOT fragmented across versions. v1.8 adds only A/B branching as a P1 enhancement.

**Event Hooks vs Policy Engine — execution order:**

v1.4 (before Event Hooks):

```

```

v1.5+ (with Event Hooks wrapping Policy Engine):

```

**Skill Lazy Loading — transition plan:**

```
v1.4 and earlier: Skills are preloaded (all instructions + tools loaded at session start)
v1.5 upgrade:
  ├─ Existing skills: preload by default (opt-out flag available)
  ├─ New skills: lazy-load by default (metadata always visible, content on invocation)
  ├─ System detects cross-skill tool references and warns if lazy-loading would break them
  └─ v1.7: all skills lazy-load by default; preload flag deprecated
```

### v1.6 — Data Connector Layer

**Focus**: Give Agents access to external data. Structured and unstructured. This was previously bundled into v1.4 (v5) as a single P0 — it is now its own version.

| Priority | Scope | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | **Data Connector SPI** | **DataConnector protocol definition. Connection lifecycle, query interface, schema discovery. Reference implementation: PostgreSQL connector.** |
| **P0** | **Document Ingestion** | **PDF/Word/Markdown/HTML → Chunking → Embedding → Per-tenant vector store.** |
| **P0** | **RAG Retrieval Pipeline** | **Semantic + keyword hybrid search + reranking. Context injection strategy (prepend/append/dynamic).** |
| **P1** | Knowledge Base Management | Tenant-isolated, ACL-controlled knowledge bases. |
| **P1** | Additional DB Connectors | MySQL, ClickHouse, SQLite connectors. |
| **P1** | API Data Sources | REST/GraphQL declarative config, normalized results. |
| **P1** | Text-to-SQL Pipeline | NL → SQL → result → Agent context. Schema catalog. |
| **P1** | AI Analysis Workbench | Data connection → Chart generation → Report/PPT export. |

**Data Connector Layer:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Data Connector Layer                      │

│                                 └─ Structured result fmt      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Incremental delivery**: v1.6 delivers the SPI + PG connector + Document Ingestion + RAG pipeline. Additional connectors (MySQL, ClickHouse, etc.) ship as Extension SPIs in subsequent minor releases.

### v1.7 — Enterprise Security, Session DAG & Multi-Run Modes

**Focus**: Enterprise-grade security, non-linear conversations, platform integration points, and DeerFlow runtime removal.

| Priority | Scope | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | Open API | REST + Webhook: Agent dialogue, workflow trigger, result query; rate limiting, API key management |
| **P0** | Third-Party Integration | Feishu/DingTalk/WeCom/Slack/Teams bidirectional |
| **P0** | SSO/LDAP | Enterprise identity integration, auto-sync org structure to tenants/roles |
| **P0** | **Runtime Security** | **Agent workspace isolation, network policy (default-deny outbound), capability tokens (Agent never sees raw API keys)** |
| **P0** | **Declarative Agent Config** | **Agent as Code (YAML/JSON), GitOps-friendly, version-controlled** |
| **P0** | **Session DAG** | **Tree/DAG-structured conversation sessions. Fork at any point, explore alternative branches, merge or discard. Includes persistent DAG storage — sessions survive process restart.** |
| **P0** | **Multi-Run Modes** | **Interactive (UI), Batch/CI (print/JSON), RPC (cross-process), SDK (embedded). Agent Loop is callable from any mode.** |
| **P0** | **DeerFlow Loop Removal** | **Remove DeerFlow's legacy LangGraph loop. Agent Loop (v1.2) is now the sole execution engine. Existing Skill/Agent compatibility verified through comparison test suite.** |
| **P1** | Multi-Model Routing | Auto-select model by task type/cost/latency |
| **P1** | **Tool Marketplace** | **Tool discovery, distribution, versioning. Tools are platform assets, not per-agent code. Distinct from v1.2 Tool Registry (which handles registration/validation).** |

**Runtime Security — three-layer model:**

| Layer | Capability | Version |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Perimeter | RBAC, audit trail, user auth, password rotation | v1.0 |
| Compliance | Policy-as-Code, OWASP Top 10, deterministic tool-call interception, tamper-evident audit | v1.4 |
| Runtime | Agent workspace isolation (sandbox per tenant) | v1.7 |
| Runtime | Network policy (default-deny outbound, allowlist) | v1.7 |
| Runtime | Short-lived capability tokens (Agent never sees raw API keys) | v1.7 |
| Runtime | Policy Engine integration with sandbox (permissions verified before every tool call) | v1.7 |
| Runtime | Unified event output (OCSF-compatible for SIEM integration) | v1.7 |

**Session DAG:**

```
                    ┌──────────┐
                    │ Session  │
                    │  Root    │
                    └────┬─────┘
                         │
              ┌──────────┼──────────┐
              ▼          ▼          ▼
         ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐
         │Branch A│ │Branch B│ │Branch C│
         │(default)│ │(try X) │ │(try Y) │
         └───┬────┘ └───┬────┘ └───┬────┘
             │          │          │
         ┌───▼───┐  ┌──▼───┐  ┌──▼───┐
         │Step 3 │  │Step 3│  │Step 3│
         │(merge)│  │(disc.)│  │(keep) │
         └───────┘  └──────┘  └──────┘
```

**Session DAG migration:**

```
v1.6 and earlier: Linear sessions (list of messages)
v1.7 upgrade:
  ├─ Existing linear sessions: represented as single-branch DAG (root = entire history)
  ├─ New sessions: start from DAG root
  ├─ /fork command: create new branch from current point
  ├─ DAG storage is persistent — branches survive process restart
  └─ No breaking change: linear sessions are a valid DAG subset
```

**Multi-Run Modes:**

| Mode | Interface | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Interactive** | Web UI + WebSocket | Daily use, conversation, exploration |
| **Batch/CI** | CLI `--print` / `--json` | Scripts, CI/CD pipelines, automated reports |
| **RPC** | gRPC / REST endpoint | Cross-process integration, microservices |
| **SDK** | `createAgentSession()` | Embedded in third-party applications |

**Policy Engine in SDK mode:**

| SDK Mode | Policy Engine | When to use |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Embedded** | Policy Engine compiled into SDK binary. YAML policies loaded from local filesystem. Zero network dependency. | Edge deployment, offline use, minimal latency |
| **Remote** | SDK calls platform Policy Engine API. Lighter SDK footprint. | Cloud deployment, centralized policy management |

### v1.8 — Context Engineering

**Focus**: Manage the Agent's context window systematically. Context determines capability ceiling — this is a platform-level concern.

| Priority | Scope | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | **Context Compression Engine** | **Pluggable compression algorithms. Sliding window (P0, simplest), summarization (P1), semantic pruning (P1). Configurable per agent. Auto-trigger on token threshold. ⚠️ High technical risk — compression quality directly impacts agent output quality.** |
| **P0** | **Token Budget Monitor** | **Current consumption, remaining budget, projected exhaustion. Real-time visualization. Auto-trigger compression when approaching limit.** |
| **P0** | Memory Strategy | Short-term (session), long-term (persistent), semantic (vector retrieval) — configurable per agent |
| **P0** | Context Window Management | Token budget visualization, overflow warnings, automatic truncation |
| **P1** | Cross-Session Continuity | "Continue from last conversation" — context inheritance with decay |
| **P1** | Retrieval Formatting | Structured results → Markdown table / JSON / natural language, configurable formatting |
| **P1** | Prompt Template A/B Branching | Compare prompt variants, data-driven selection |

*(Note: Summarization and semantic pruning are P1 algorithms within the Context Compression Engine P0 above, not separate items.)*

### v1.9 — Observability, SRE Governance & Evaluation

**Focus**: Measure, improve, and protect Agent quality in production.

| Priority | Scope | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | Agent Runtime Metrics | Success rate, latency, token consumption, user satisfaction |
| **P0** | Workflow Analytics | Bottleneck identification, failure hotspots, optimization suggestions |
| **P0** | **Evaluation Framework** | **Offline eval (test suites), online eval (production sampling), human annotation pipeline** |
| **P0** | **Feedback Loop** | **User rating → auto sample collection → prompt/model iteration** |
| **P0** | A/B Testing | Compare different prompts/models/processes, data-driven iteration |
| **P0** | Cost Attribution | Tenant/user/agent/workflow four-level cost allocation, budget alerts with auto circuit-breaker |
| **P1** | **SLO & Error Budgets** | **Per-agent SLO (latency p95, success rate, token efficiency). Budget exhaustion → auto-degradation.** |
| **P1** | **Chaos Testing** | **Agent fault injection, tool timeout simulation, model hallucination testing, network partition drills** |
| **P1** | **Kill Switch (Per-Agent)** | **Extends v1.3 infrastructure kill switch to per-agent granularity.** |
| **P1** | **Circuit Breaker (SLO-driven)** | **Extends v1.3 circuit breaker: auto-throttle agents exceeding error budget. SLO-driven, not failure-count-driven.** |

**Kill Switch & Circuit Breaker — version evolution:**

| Version | Kill Switch | Circuit Breaker |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| v1.3 | Infrastructure-level: stop all workflows per tenant/workflow | Failure-count-based: pause after N consecutive failures |
| v1.9 | Extended to per-agent granularity | Extended to SLO-driven: throttle when error budget exhausted |

**Evaluation Pipeline:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Evaluation Pipeline              │
│                                              │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### v2.0 — Autonomous Runtime + Identity Mesh + Federation

**Focus**: Architectural independence and cross-organization interoperability.

| Priority | Scope | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | Autonomous Agent Runtime | Replace DeerFlow dependency entirely. Agent Loop (v1.2), Tool Registry (v1.2), Message System (v1.2), Policy Engine (v1.4) are already decoupled from DeerFlow internals via abstraction layers. Only LangGraph orchestration remains to be replaced to achieve full independence. |
| **P0** | **Identity Mesh** | **SPIFFE/DID/mTLS credentials for every agent. Trust scoring and delegation chain management. "Which agent did this?" answered with cryptographic certainty.** |
| **P0** | **Open Governance Toolkit** | **Policy Engine, RBAC, Audit, and Cost Attribution released as standalone open-source libraries (Apache 2.0). Independent repositories. Platform team maintains.** |
| **P1** | Central Skill Registry | Cross-tenant/cross-organization skill sharing and trading (npm-like, enterprise-grade permissions) |
| **P1** | Agent Federation | Cross-organization Agent interoperability: discovery, auth, permission boundaries, billing, versioning |
| **P1** | Low-Code Workflow Designer | Visual orchestration for non-technical users (drag-and-drop nodes, parameter configuration) |
| **P1** | Edge Deployment | Lightweight runtime deployed to customer environments, data stays on-premises, cloud unified management |

**Open Governance Toolkit — scope:**

| Component | Description | License |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `govern-policy-engine` | Deterministic tool-call interception engine. YAML Policy-as-Code evaluator. | Apache 2.0 |
| `govern-rbac` | Multi-tenant role-based access control. Three-tier roles. | Apache 2.0 |
| `govern-audit` | Merkle-tree tamper-evident audit logging. Decision BOM. | Apache 2.0 |
| `govern-cost` | Four-level cost attribution (tenant/user/agent/workflow). Budget alerts. | Apache 2.0 |

Each component is an independent repository, usable standalone or together. The platform itself consumes these libraries (dogfooding).

**Incremental migration strategy:**

```
v1.2: Agent Loop extracted (parallel to DeerFlow, feature-flag toggle)
v1.3: Agent Loop becomes default; DeerFlow loop marked deprecated
v1.4: Policy Engine independent (abstraction layer decoupled from DeerFlow internals)
v1.7: DeerFlow loop removed; only Agent Loop remains
v2.0: LangGraph orchestration replaced (last DeerFlow component)
      → DeerFlow dependency fully removed
```

### 3.4 Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Agent Loop extraction | v1.2: abstraction layer over LangGraph (decoupling). v1.3: becomes default. v1.7: DeerFlow loop removed. v2.0: LangGraph replaced entirely. | Gradual decoupling→replacement; v1.2 is NOT independence from LangGraph, only decoupling |
| Workflow engine | Self-developed DAG + Saga (idempotent retry + selective compensation); Agent Loop as execution unit | Keep orchestration controllable; Agent Loop is decoupled from (not independent of) Workflow |
| Agent Loop vs Workflow | Coexistence, not competition | Agent = "employee", Workflow = "project manager" |
| Governance model | Three-layer: Perimeter (v1.0) + Compliance (v1.4) + Runtime (v1.7) | Defense in depth; NVIDIA + Microsoft AGT |
| Policy enforcement | Deterministic code-level interception; always-on builtin, not optional plugin | Microsoft AGT: "Model-layer defenses are probabilistic" |
| Policy Engine deployment | Platform embedded (default), SDK embedded (offline), SDK remote (lightweight) | Three deployment modes for different use cases |
| Event Hooks vs Policy Engine | Hooks can augment, cannot veto. Policy Engine is final authority. | Separation of concerns: extensibility ≠ governance |
| Policy language | YAML-based declarative policies | Industry standard (Microsoft AGT, Kubernetes); GitOps-friendly |
| Policy transition | OWASP high-severity: default deny. Custom: default allow → user writes policies. | Safe migration: no breaking change, progressive hardening |
| Extension system | Two SPI categories: Builtin (always on) + Extension (optional) | Governance is not optional; everything else is |
| Skill loading | Progressive disclosure (lazy-load); v1.5 upgrade: existing preload, new lazy; v1.7: all lazy | Backward compatible; cross-skill reference detection |
| Tool Registry vs Tool Marketplace | Registry (v1.2): register/discover/validate. Marketplace (v1.7): distribute/version/rate. | Different concerns: registration ≠ distribution |
| Prompt Template delivery | Complete system in v1.5 (variable injection, version mgmt, per-tenant defaults, slash-command). A/B branching in v1.8 (P1). | Not fragmented across versions |
| Kill Switch & Circuit Breaker | v1.3: infrastructure-level. v1.9: extended to per-agent + SLO-driven. | Progressive enhancement, not redefinition |
| Session model | DAG/tree structure with persistent storage. Linear sessions migrate as single-branch DAG. | Pi-Agent: fork/resume/compare is essential |
| Run modes | Four modes: Interactive, Batch/CI, RPC, SDK | Pi-Agent: same Agent Loop, different interfaces |
| Cross-organization federation | Identity mesh (SPIFFE/DID/mTLS) + OAuth2 REST | Microsoft AGT identity model |
| Context engineering | Platform layer, not per-agent | Context is shared concern |
| Evaluation framework | Offline + Online + Human annotation + SRE governance | Full-lifecycle quality measurement |
| Audit structure | Merkle-tree tamper-evident logs + Decision BOM | Microsoft AGT audit model |
| Open Governance Toolkit | 4 independent Apache 2.0 libraries; separate repos; platform team maintained | Microsoft AGT precedent; dogfooding |

## 4. Risks & Migration

### 4.1 Main Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Agent Loop extraction breaks DeerFlow integration | Agent execution fails during transition | Parallel run with feature-flag toggle; automated comparison testing; v1.3 Agent Loop becomes default; v1.7 DeerFlow loop removed |
| Policy engine performance overhead | Tool-call latency increase | Deterministic (no LLM call); target <1ms overhead; Rust core option for hot path |
| Extension system complexity | Five levers may overwhelm users | Each lever independently usable; start with Plugins + Skills (v1.1/v1.5), add Hooks incrementally |
| Workflow engine and Agent Loop state inconsistency | Agent executing when Workflow restarts | Workflow only stores "invocation handle"; Agent Loop state managed independently; Saga retries/compensates |
| Skill lazy-loading breaks cross-skill references | Skill A's instructions reference Skill B's tools | v1.5 auto-detects cross-skill tool references; existing skills preload by default; v1.7 all lazy |
| Context engineering scope creep | v1.8 becomes overloaded | Only 4 P0s defined; compression engine, token monitor, memory strategy, window management |
| Data connector security | Tenant data leakage | Per-tenant vector store isolation; Text-to-SQL logged and schema-access controlled; Policy engine wraps all data access |
| A2A protocol fragmentation | Incompatible with Google's A2A | Monitor standardization; protocol adapter pattern for backend swap |
| Compliance rule maintenance | OWASP Top 10 evolves | Community-contributed rule packs; policy lint; versioned rule sets |
| Federated ecosystem trust model | v2.0 delayed | v1.7 first implement "cross-tenant" federation; v2.0 extend to "cross-platform" via identity mesh |
| Autonomous runtime replacement | Existing Skill/Agent incompatible | API compatibility layer; migration tools; LTS version maintained in parallel for 6 months |
| **DeerFlow upstream maintenance risk** | DeerFlow (ByteDance) stops maintenance or pivots; v1.2–v1.7 depend on it | Agent Loop abstraction (v1.2) decouples platform code from DeerFlow internals; earlier extraction = lower risk; v2.0 fully removes dependency |
| **Vector store scalability wall** | pgvector performance degrades at >10M vectors; users hit a wall after v1.6 deployment | v1.6 ships pgvector only; document the scalability ceiling; Milvus/Qdrant support as P1 in v1.6+ minor release; migration path documented |

### 4.2 Migration Path

```
v1.0 → v1.1: Zero migration, ops plugins enabled by default, behavior unchanged.

v1.1 → v1.2: Agent Loop extracted as abstraction layer over LangGraph (parallel to existing DeerFlow loop, feature-flag toggle).
              Tool Registry + Message System are additive. Default: DeerFlow loop. Opt-in: Agent Loop abstraction.

v1.2 → v1.3: Agent Loop becomes default; DeerFlow loop marked deprecated.
              Workflow engine, Saga, kill switch, circuit breaker are additive.
              Existing workflows continue to work.

v1.3 → v1.4: Policy Engine deployed as builtin (always on).
              OWASP high-severity rules: default deny (platform-managed).
              Custom policies: default allow (tenant writes their own).
              agt verify shows policy coverage gaps. No breaking change.

v1.4 → v1.5: Custom Agent upgraded to "full framework".
              Extension system: Builtin SPIs + Extension SPIs + Event Hooks + Skills (lazy) + Templates.
              Skills: existing preload by default, new lazy by default.
              Cross-skill reference detection warns before lazy-loading.
              Prompt Template system delivered complete (variable injection, version mgmt, per-tenant defaults).
              A2A enabled per-tenant.

v1.5 → v1.6: Data Connector SPI + PG connector + Document Ingestion + RAG pipeline.
              Additional connectors (MySQL, ClickHouse, etc.) ship as subsequent Extension SPIs.
              Vector store infrastructure added (pgvector default).
              AI Analysis Workbench enabled per-tenant (if P1 delivered).

v1.6 → v1.7: DeerFlow loop removed; only Agent Loop remains (v1.2 Agent Loop is now the sole execution engine).
              Session DAG is additive (linear sessions migrate as single-branch DAG).
              DAG storage is persistent — branches survive process restart.
              Multi-run modes are additive (web UI still primary).
              Open API + runtime security disabled by default.
              Agent as Code is additive. Skill preload flag deprecated (all skills now lazy).

v1.7 → v1.8: Context engineering is additive. Existing agents use default strategies.
              Compression engine, token monitor, memory strategy. Prompt Template A/B branching is opt-in (P1).

v1.8 → v1.9: Observability data auto-collected.
              SLO, chaos testing, kill switch (per-agent), circuit breaker (SLO-driven) enabled per-tenant.
              Historical data not backfilled.

v1.x → v2.0: Agent Loop, Tool Registry, Message System, Policy Engine already decoupled from DeerFlow internals from v1.2–v1.4.
              Only LangGraph orchestration remains to be replaced (the sole remaining DeerFlow dependency).
              Grayscale migration. Identity mesh is additive.
              Open Governance Toolkit released as 4 separate Apache 2.0 repos.
```

## 5. Appendix

### 5.1 Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Digital Employee** | A configured Agent with specific persona, skills, and tool access, serving as a virtual team member |
| **Scenario Pack** | A collection of plugins (EventSource + Executor + Notifier + DataConnector) for a specific vertical domain |
| **Builtin SPI** | A plugin interface that is always active and cannot be disabled (PolicyEnforcer). Only policy strictness is configurable. |
| **Extension SPI** | A plugin interface that is optional and config-toggleable (EventSource, Executor, Notifier, DataConnector). |
| **Federation** | Cross-organization Agent interoperability with mutual authentication, permission boundaries, and billing |
| **Executor** | A workflow node implementation that performs a concrete action (call Agent, execute code, send HTTP request, etc.) |
| **Context Engineering** | The systematic design and management of what goes into an Agent's context window — templates, compression, retrieval, memory |
| **Harness** | The engineering layer around the model: tools, context, memory, evaluation, governance. The platform's core competency beyond model selection. |
| **A2A** | Agent-to-Agent protocol — standardized discovery, capability advertisement, and invocation between Agents |
| **Data Flywheel** | Feedback → sample collection → prompt/model refinement → redeployment → more feedback |
| **Policy as Code** | Declarative YAML policies defining agent behavior boundaries; version-controlled, reviewable, GitOps-friendly |
| **Decision BOM** | Bill of Materials for every governance decision: active policy, agent request, allow/deny reason — cryptographically verifiable |
| **Saga** | Idempotent retry + selective compensation pattern. Each step has idempotent retry with exponential backoff; steps with reversible side effects (e.g., sent notifications) support compensating rollback; steps with irreversible side effects (e.g., executed SQL) support retry only. Most Agent workflow steps support retry, not compensation. |
| **Identity Mesh** | SPIFFE/DID/mTLS-based identity layer answering "Which agent did this?" with cryptographic certainty |
| **Kill Switch** | Emergency stop mechanism. v1.3: infrastructure-level (workflow/tenant). v1.9: extended to per-agent granularity. |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Auto-throttle mechanism. v1.3: failure-count-based. v1.9: extended to SLO-driven. |
| **Agent Loop** | The think→act→observe→think cycle that is the core of any Agent. In v1.2–v1.7, it is an abstraction layer over LangGraph (decoupling platform code from LangGraph-specific APIs). In v2.0, LangGraph is replaced by an autonomous runtime, making the Agent Loop truly independent of any orchestration framework. |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Skills load metadata (name + description) eagerly, full instructions + tools only when invoked. Reduces context pollution. |
| **Session DAG** | Non-linear conversation structure: fork at any point, explore alternatives, keep or discard branches. Sessions are graphs, not lists. Persistent storage — survives process restart. |
