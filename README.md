## Why OpsinTech Exists

### DeerFlow: A Proven Agent Runtime

DeerFlow proved that AI Agents can go beyond chat — they can plan, decompose tasks, execute code in isolated sandboxes, and produce real files and deliverables. Sub-agent parallelism, persistent memory, sandbox isolation — these capabilities earned it 37K+ GitHub stars, and deservedly so.

### From Agent Runtime to Production Platform

DeerFlow excels as an Agent runtime and developer toolkit. OpsinTech builds on top of it to address what teams need when moving from evaluation to production:

| Scenario | DeerFlow | OpsinTech Enhancement |
|---|---|---|
| **Team Collaboration** | Single-user mode | Multi-tenancy with `user → tenant → global` isolation |
| **Access Control** | No role-based permissions | RBAC with `platform_admin` / `tenant_admin` / `tenant_member` |
| **Model Configuration** | Hand-edited YAML files | 20+ provider templates in admin UI, database-backed, per-tenant assignment |
| **Administration** | Command-line scripts only | Visual admin dashboards for both platform and tenant levels |
| **Audit & Compliance** | No operation traceability | Full audit trail for all operations, per-tenant isolation |
| **Skills & MCP** | Functional runtime, manual setup | Per-tenant management via admin UI, lifecycle tracking |
| **Security Governance** | Basic sandbox isolation | User status management, mandatory password rotation, operation audit |
| **Onboarding** | Configuration-heavy, steep learning curve | Docker one-command deploy, admin UI-driven setup |

### Our Approach

We're not starting from scratch. DeerFlow's Agent runtime is one of the most mature in open source, and for v1.0 we chose to inherit it — then layer on what teams need to use it in production.

**Short-term (v1.x)**: Keep DeerFlow's runtime, add the governance layer — multi-tenancy, RBAC, audit, admin dashboards, database-backed config, model provider templates.

**Long-term (v2.x+)**: Gradually replace DeerFlow internal dependencies with our own architecture, incorporating real operations scenarios — alert ingestion, incident management, workflow orchestration, governed terminals — to form a true AI-Native Operations Platform.

## v1.0 — What We Built

### Multi-Tenancy & RBAC

- **Three-tier resource isolation**: `user → tenant → global`, strict data separation
- **Two admin dashboards**: Platform admin (users, tenants, audit, model templates) + Tenant admin (members, models, tools, skills)
- **Auto-created personal tenant** on registration, zero manual setup
- Roles: `platform_admin` / `tenant_admin` / `tenant_member`

### Model Management, Done Right

- **20+ provider templates** in the admin UI — dropdown to select, auto-fills provider class, base URL, and capability flags. No LangChain class paths to memorize
- Models stored in database, assigned per-tenant, with active / deprecated / retired lifecycle
- Providers: OpenAI · Anthropic · DeepSeek · Azure OpenAI · Gemini · Ollama · OpenRouter · Groq · Together AI · SiliconFlow · DashScope · Zhipu · Moonshot · MiniMax · Baichuan · 01.AI · Volcengine Ark · Novita AI

### Audit & Security

- Full audit trail for all operations, per-tenant isolation
- User status management (active / suspended)
- Mandatory password change on first login

### Internationalization

- UI supports 4 languages: English, 中文, 日本語, 한국어
- Auto-detects browser language preference with manual switcher

### Deployment & Operations

- **Docker one-command deploy**: `docker compose up -d`
- Artifact management: browse, preview, download all agent-generated files
- Platform announcement system with tenant/role targeting

## Our Vision

OpsinTech is not "DeerFlow with a dashboard." We're building a **secure, governed, AI-Native Operations Platform for production environments**.

On this platform, Agents don't just chat and generate code — they operate within boundaries: permission controls, audit records, execution approvals. Starting from Agent conversations, progressively extending into alerting, incidents, workflows, and terminal execution, ultimately forming a complete chain:

> **Discover → Understand → Decide → Execute → Audit**

This space is almost entirely vacant in open source. That's why we need community voices.

**Who we're looking for**: If you work in operations, security, compliance, or platform engineering, and you're excited by AI Agents but can't use them in production because of missing governance and security — you're exactly who we're building for. Your pain points and suggestions are OpsinTech's roadmap.

```

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and configure**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/opsintech/opsintech-platform.git
   cd opsintech-platform
   make config
   ```

   Generates `config.yaml` with platform-level settings (database, sandbox, tool groups). **No model configuration needed.**

2. **Start and log in**

   ```bash
   make up
   ```

   Open http://localhost:2026. On first visit, you'll be redirected to the Setup Wizard to set your admin email and password.

   > You can also use `docker compose up -d`, but `make up` handles config initialization and secret generation automatically.

3. **Add models via admin UI**

   Log in as platform admin, go to **Settings → Models**, pick from 20+ provider templates, enter your API key.

   > Models are stored in the database. Do **not** configure models in `config.yaml` for production.

### Running Options

**Docker production**:
```bash
make up              # Build images and start all services (recommended for first deploy)
make up-nobuild      # Start services without rebuilding images
make down            # Stop and remove containers
make rebuild-images  # Remove all OpsinTech images and rebuild from scratch
```

**Local development**:
```bash
make check           # Verify prerequisites (Node.js 22+, pnpm, uv, nginx)
make install         # Install dependencies
make dev             # Start dev servers (with hot-reload)
make stop            # Stop all services
```

**Docker development**:
```bash
make docker-init     # Pull sandbox image
make docker-start    # Start Docker dev services
make docker-stop     # Stop Docker dev services
make docker-logs     # View all logs
```

Access: http://localhost:2026

### China Users: Preparing Images

In China, pulling base images during Docker builds may fail due to network issues. Pre-pull before building:

```bash
# Required images
docker pull python:3.12-slim
docker pull node:22-alpine
docker pull nginx:alpine
docker pull docker:cli

# Build-stage dependency
docker pull ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.9.26

# Optional images
docker pull postgres:16-alpine          # PostgreSQL mode
docker pull enterprise-public-cn-beijing.cr.volces.com/vefaas-public/all-in-one-sandbox:latest  # Sandbox
```

For mirror accelerator setup, see the [Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md#china-users-preparing-images-for-local-builds).

### Advanced

#### Sandbox Mode

Three execution modes: Local / Docker containers / Docker + Kubernetes. See [Sandbox Guide](backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#sandbox).

#### MCP Server

Configurable MCP servers (managed per-tenant via admin UI). Supports stdio/SSE/HTTP transports with OAuth token flows.

### DeerFlow

v1.0 is built on [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) (by ByteDance). DeerFlow's Agent runtime — LangGraph orchestration, sub-agent parallelism, sandboxed execution, persistent memory — is one of the best Agent infrastructures in open source. Deep gratitude to the DeerFlow team and community.

**Our relationship with DeerFlow**: In v1.x, we inherit DeerFlow's Agent runtime and add governance. As we evolve, we'll gradually replace internal dependencies and form our own architecture. OpsinTech's long-term identity is not a DeerFlow fork — it's an independent, operations-focused AI-Native platform.
